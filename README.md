COVID-19 has upended and fundamentally changed every one of our lives for 1 Â½ years and counting. 
With multiple and continued COVID-19 lockdowns occurring in almost all of Australia, we will be investigating the million-dollar questions of when and how should these lockdowns be enforced? 
And what are the subsequent effects on COVID-19 infections? Some governments may enforce harsh lockdowns to prevent as many COVID-19 infections as possible, 
but how much strength is necessary? On the other hand, how much freedom should citizens and businesses be given to live and operate,
without too many infections to overwhelm health systems?

In this analysis, we will attempt to perform some data analysis to analyse the effectiveness of lockdown measures on COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we will analyse a measure called 'Stringency Index' and its impact on COVID-19 case numbers in Australia.
